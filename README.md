Hey there, I'm Akansh, a tech enthusiast willing to learn more along with you. I love to seek 
information aboout how things work and hence this enthusiasm drives me to learn continously.

Being a person who wants to recieve valuable information and contribute things to the community makes me more inclined towards open source.
Working on global projects and contributing my  part would be a great learning experience.\
Hence it would be great joining a team consisiting of individuals like me ready to gain information and guide others their path that is "OPEN SOURCE TEAM CODING CLUB IITG"
